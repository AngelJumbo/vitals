## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/AngelJumbo/vitals
cd vitals
sudo make install
```
## Before you ask me
### GPU?
~~Yes, I will add it. But if you want to contribute the necessary code I would gladly accept it :'), just try to put it next to the ram box.~~ Done.
### Is this another top/htop replacement?
~~No, just a system usage visualizer~~ It is, press TAB to view process.
### Why? Btop already shows the system usage
I wanted something simpler, less busy and readable.
### BSD's and macOS?
I don't run any of them, but I will accept contributions to support them.
### Flatpak?
I'm too lazy for that... sorry.
