Yes you will need to download gmake.

cd vitals/freebsd
sudo gmake install
```

## Before you ask me
### GPU?
~~Yes, I will add it. But if you want to contribute the necessary code I would gladly accept it :'), just try to put it next to the ram box.~~ Done.
### Is this another top/htop replacement?
~~No, just a system usage visualizer~~ It is, press TAB to view process.
### Why? Btop already shows the system usage
I wanted something simpler, less busy and readable.
### macOS?
I don't run macos, but I will accept contributions to support it.
### Flatpak?
I'm too lazy for that... sorry.
