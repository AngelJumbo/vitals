## Linux Installation

git clone https://github.com/AngelJumbo/vitals
cd vitals
sudo make install
```
## Freebsd Installation
Yes you will need to download gmake.
(I haven't tested it on openBSD or netBSD yet I will in the next few days) 
```
git clone https://github.com/AngelJumbo/vitals
cd vitals/freebsd
sudo gmake install
```

## Before you ask me
### GPU?
Done. The gpu have been added
### Is this another top/htop replacement?
~~No, just a system usage visualizer~~ It is, press TAB to view process.
### Why? Btop already shows the system usage
I wanted something simpler, less busy and readable.
### macOS?
I don't run macos, but I will accept contributions to support it.
### Flatpak?
I'm too lazy for that... sorry.
